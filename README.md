- üìä Numeric slider for number-based answers
- ‚úÖ Multiple-choice questions with four options
- üé• YouTube video recommendations for incorrect answers
- üí¨ Natural conversation flow

## Setup

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CORS Fix Required

This application requires a backend proxy to work because browsers cannot make direct requests to the Anthropic API due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions.

### Quick Start

1. **Deploy the Cloudflare Worker proxy** (required to fix CORS errors)
   - Follow the instructions in [CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT.md](./CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT.md)
   - This will create a secure proxy that handles API requests
   - Your API key stays secure in the worker's environment variables

2. **Update the frontend**
   - Open `index.html`
   - Replace `YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_WORKER_URL_HERE` with your deployed worker URL
   - Example: `https://interactive-learning-assistant-proxy.your-subdomain.workers.dev`

3. **Open the application**
   - Open `index.html` in your browser, or
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static hosting

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Backend Proxy**: Cloudflare Workers (serverless)
- **AI Model**: Claude Haiku 4.5 via Anthropic API

## Why Do I Need a Proxy?

Web browsers block direct API calls to external services (like the Anthropic API) for security reasons. This is called CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

**The solution**: A serverless proxy (Cloudflare Worker) that:
- Receives requests from your browser
- Adds your API key securely
- Forwards requests to the Anthropic API
- Returns responses to your browser

This keeps your API key secure (never exposed in browser code) and solves the CORS issue.

## Cost

- **Cloudflare Workers Free Tier**: 100,000 requests/day (plenty for personal use)
- **Anthropic API**: Pay-as-you-go pricing
